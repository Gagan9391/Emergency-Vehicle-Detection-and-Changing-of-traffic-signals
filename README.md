# Emergency-Vehicle-Detection-and-Changing-of-traffic-signals
The project involves the development of an Emergency Vehicle Detection System that utilizes advanced image detection technology. This system is designed to identify emergency vehicles in real-time. Additionally, an Intelligent Traffic Signal Control mechanism is implemented using sound detection technology. The traffic signals dynamically adjust to prioritize the passage of detected emergency vehicles, contributing to improved traffic management and swift emergency response. This innovative solution enhances overall road safety and efficiency by leveraging cutting-edge technologies in image and sound detection for intelligent traffic signal control.
